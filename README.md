# ANN-Prediction
# As Part of the Deep Learning A-Z Course, I implemented predicting whether customers were likely to leave
# a bank or not based on previously available Labelled data

# This is a supervised deep learning apporach with the output activation function being Sigmoid;
# Hence, we get a probability of how likely a customer is to leave the bank and an optimal threshold can be set to compare the predictions to testing data
